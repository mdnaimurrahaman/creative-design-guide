This FirYawee Smartwatch has much more options and color features that link and sync to a phone app. From the phone app you can control the watch; or you can control the watch by itself. I’m so happy with this purchase.",

I've unintentionally bashed it many times when doing daily stuff and while I do have some scratches on the face, the watch has held up beautifully. ",
